# Speckle

A JavaScript module that adds responsive, stylized speckles to any element; with no dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Installation

### Usage

Import the module using ES6.

`import Speckle from 'speckle-js';`

The module can also be required using CommonJS.

Use the constructor by passing a valid HTML element as the first argument, and an options object of `key: value` pairs as the second argument.

`new Speckle(element, options);`
